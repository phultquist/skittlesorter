# Skittle Sorter
The skittle sorter is a project for Microcontroller Applications that sorts skittles based on colors.

Using 2 color sensors, 2-3 arduinos (depending on if you want a display), a couple of circuit board components, and a suite of 3D printed parts, it reads and ensures every skittle goes into the right spot. Additionally, it auto-calibrates the cup placement. 

Circuit model coming soon.
